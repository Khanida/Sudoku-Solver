# Sudoku Solver User Guide

Welcome to the Sudoku Solver! This Python program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find a solution for a given Sudoku puzzle. Follow this guide to use the code effectively:

## Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python's official website.

## Instructions:
1. Prepare your Sudoku puzzle:
      - Open the Python script in your preferred code editor.
      - Locate the grid variable in the main code section. Replace the placeholder values with your Sudoku puzzle. Use 0 for empty cells.
2. Run the code:
   -Save the changes to the script.
   -Open a terminal or command prompt.
   -Navigate to the directory containing the script using the cd command.
   -Run the script by entering python script_name.py (replace script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script).
3. View the solution:
    -If a solution is found, the program will print the solved Sudoku grid.
    -If there's no solution for the given puzzle, it will print "No Solution For This Sudoku."

## Example:
Let's say you have the following Sudoku puzzle:

grid = [

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 9],
    [3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5],
    [4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 9, 0, 2],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6],
    [9, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8],
    [7, 0, 0, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

After running the script, if a solution exists, the output will be the solved Sudoku grid.

## Notes:
  - Ensure your Sudoku puzzle adheres to the rules (unique numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid).  
  - The program assumes a valid Sudoku puzzle. Unexpected behavior may occur if the input violates Sudoku rules.

Now you're ready to use the Sudoku Solver! Have fun solving Sudoku puzzles effortlessly.
